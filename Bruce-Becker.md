Bruce Becker is a real person. He writes this blog as often as he likes, on whatever he feels. Feel free to leave comments, but don't expect them to be automatically published. He's kinda picky about who says what. 

Bruce used to be a physicist... kinda. He got a Ph.D. from the University of Cape Town and did a few postdocs, but things just took a bit of a turn somewhere down the line. Although he's a bit wacko about the universe (the whole "crap, this thing actually exists, that's so weird" thing), he gets depressed by the fact that he's not up to investigating it himself. Had a big fight with maths in second year, never really got over it. So now he like the big shiny stuff.

Well, not even that... he refers to big shiny stuff as porn mostly. Cos it kinda is, if you think about it. 

What really makes him happy is when he sees scientists getting work done in a transparent, sustainable manner. Oh gosh, that sounds a little pompous... oh well, so be it. 

Bruce is a real person. A pompous, real person.
