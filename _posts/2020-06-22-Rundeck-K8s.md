## üçÖ 1 - Jumping right in

We're using Rundeck to manage operations tasks, and we've chosen Kubernetes as a deployment platform.
The reasons for this are not relevant to this post, so we have to take them for granted for now.
Other pieces of tooling that we should take for granted are Jenkins for the continuous integration pipeline, Helm for the packaging model and Spinnaker for the continuous deployment pipeline.

I'm writing this post in order to reason about and hopefully resolve issues encountered in writing the helm chart.
I will also be using the pomodoro method to keep pace and try to measure my progress, but mostly because I have this cool Sense HAT which counts down the time for me in a naff LED matrix.

I'm coming back to this deployment after a few days concentrating on other things.
This morning, I made two simple changes to the chart metadata, which broke the deployment, even though the build has been passing for several months:

<!-- 'Screenshot_2020-06-22 master [Infra ¬ª rundeck ¬ª infra-rundeck] [Jenkins].png' -->

Strangely enough, even though there are builds going back to May, only the last deploy is showing.
The manifest seems to have baked properly, it is correct YAML - but the deploy failed.
The error message from Spinnaker is quite long, but this caught my eye:

```
"status": map[
  "availableReplicas":'\x01',
  "conditions": [
    map[
      "lastTransitionTime": "2020-05-26T08:33:20Z",
      "lastUpdateTime": "2020-05-26T08:33:20Z",
      "message": "Deployment has minimum availability.",
      "reason":"MinimumReplicasAvailable",
      "status":"True",
      "type":"Available"],
    map[
      "lastTransitionTime": "2020-05-25T17:28:37Z",
      "lastUpdateTime": "2020-05-26T08:33:20Z",
      "message": "ReplicaSet "infra-rundeck-7558cb87b8" has successfully progressed.",
      "reason": "NewReplicaSetAvailable" "status": "True" "type":"Progressing"
    ]
  ],
  "observedGeneration": '\x11',
  "readyReplicas": '\x01',
  "replicas": '\x01',
  "updatedReplicas": '\x01'
]
]
}
for: "STDIN": unrecognized type: string
```

... I have no idea what this means.

On the one hand, it seems like the replicas are ok, but there is some weird problem with the data set in the `configMap`. There seems to be some encoded data returned.

Let's see what `describe-pod` says:

`RUNDECK_FEATURE_REPOSITORY_ENABLED: <empty>` ü§î perhaps this is the issue?
It's set in `values-nonprod.yaml` as:

```
RUNDECK_FEATURE_REPOSITORY_ENABLED: "true"
```

Perhaps I need to let booleans be booleans?
