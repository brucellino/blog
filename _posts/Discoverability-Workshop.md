# Thoughts from #scholarAfrica

I recently attended a [workshop](http://openuct.uct.ac.za/blog/promoting-discoverability-african-scholarship) in Nairobi addressing the discoverability of African research, called by the Carnegie Corporation and organised by the [OpenUCT Initative](http://openuct.uct.ac.za). Going in to the workshop, I shared a lot of thoughts and bounced a lot of ideas around with [Michelle Willmers](https://www.twitter.com/scaprogramme), the workshop coordinator, as well as **Kaitlin Thaney** from the [Mozilla Science Labs](https://mozillascience.org), **Tezira Lore** from [ILRI](http://www.ilri.cgiar.org), **Firoze Manji** from [CODESRIA](http://www.codesria.org) (Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa)  and **Ernesto Priego** from City College London. 

Let it be noted that these people are way more qualified than I ever would be to talk about scholarship in the 21st century ! The truth of the matter is that I had pretty much no idea what to expect. Ostensibly, I was to going to be representing the [CHAIN-REDS](https://www.chain-project.eu) project, and talking about infrastructure currently in place to support discoverability, essentially in terms of the Africa Arabia Regional Operations Centre.

It's a modern truism that you can assign any statement to any person, real or fictitious, on the internet. To continue this fine tradition, I claimed today that Rihanna was to blame for *Single Ladies* 

# Themes and ideas
The workshop touched on several concepts which are very hard to pin down, living between Open Access, Open Science, data citation, Altmetrics, preservation, impact. Some of the initial presentations to set the stage focussed on setting the scene : how important it was to contemplate the entire process of knowledge generation, not just the "refined" end product (the paper).
