What's going on at UFS ? There is some network wierdness happening there since at least yesterday (27/04). I'm working on `data-gateway.sagrid.ac.za` and it's losing connectivity from time to time. Looks like the typical DNS stuff we're unfortunately used to on SAGrid, since ssh to host numbers is working fine and established connections are not dropped. I'm seeing this on datagateway as well as science-gateway. Bummer, it's really slowing down work.
