# Thoughts on Strategy for an e-Infrastructure Commons

I've been tasked with writing a strategy for "SAGrid" in the context of the National Integrated Cyberinfrastructure System. While a mission statement, goals and strategy originally existed for SAGrid, back when it actually was a grid, things have evolved since we started this adventure in 2009. Since I've been so personally involved in the project, it's hard to extricate myself from the narrative, which is why this is being published on my personal blog rather than in some official document. If you have strong feelings, please don't hesitate to comment below and hey, maybe you'd like to help me write this strategy ?

## Openness

Apart from the many technological (r)evolutions that we've witnessed during the last few years, there has been one major socialogical shift in the communities of scientists - the shift towards **Openness**. Open as in :

  * [Open Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)
  * Open Access
  * Open Standards

I'm not learned enough personally to argue (at least not with the data to back up claims) that "Science = Openness", and certainly there are domains (pharma, duh) where secrecy is paramount. But let's take a step back and talk not of how things are but how we think they *should* be. It's hard to argue the case that a publicly-funded research infrastructure as cross-cutting as e-Infrastructure *should* be closed.

## The Commons

SAGrid was founded on the principle of *collective action* - we created a fedearation of human, electronic and physical resources that belonged to no single institute, but were shared and coordinated by a third-party. Sounded great, and if it had been actually implmented this way, we may have seen far better success, but what actually happened was a sort of reluctant "ceding of territory" by the participating institutes to this coordinating third party (the CSIR in this case), which many people then came to believe was "the grid". This put it at odds with other projects, institutes and services, instead of allowing it to become a catalyst for the sharing of resources and scaling of activities. This is, in my opinion, a travesty and something I'd kinda like to help fix.

There has been a lot said about "The Commons" - there are the Creative Commons, and the Public Domain; there's even a [Creative Commons for Science](http://creativecommons.org/science), and there's an intensive movement for making a scholarly commons, by opening access to scholarly communications of all kinds. However, we still haven't made the case well for a commons of Cyberinfrastructure. Everybody *still* wants to do everything themselves, when it comes to building computational and data infrastructure. The reasons are manifold... Perhaps because ["Nobody does it better"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfmQe_eBvrc) (than themselves); perhaps because they're scared that "sharing = ceding"; perhaps just because the interfaces were obtuse and unnatural. Certainly all of the above is true, but I think the fundamental point of a Commons is :

> You get out what you put in.

##  Have you tried rebooting the system ?

I think it's fair to say that SAGrid  did not become what I wanted. It can be useful to draw a line in sand, to define an end of a period, to say "le Roi est morte, vive le Roi !". With the development of NICIS, we have a perfect opportunity to re-design the collaborative, open, participatory infrastructure that I had originally envisioned.

# Systems thinking for Cyberinfrastructure.

The [National Integrated Cyberinfrastructure System](http://www.dst.gov.za/index.php/resource-center/cyber-infrastructure2) (NICIS) defines a framework for the creation of national cyberinfrastructure. It makes provision for centralised funding and deployment of computing, data and network infrastructure This acknowledges the wide variety of needs that are faced by scientific communities and individual researchers, as well as the scale of large projects which rely fundamentally on e-Infrastructure. The point at which researchers are no longer able to provide for themselves the tools which they need to successfully undertake research represents a phase change in the system of research - one at which it is more efficient to collaborate and exchange services, than it is to perform everything in a self-sustaining way. This point is seen over and again in various aspects of society, and thus many of the considerations of this document will be addressed at such "societal" issues of research. Technological advance will not be arrested or even decelerated in the forseeable future - quite to the contrary - but scientific research *will* be conducted (or at least directed) by collaborations of  humans for the forseeable future. I propose that this principle should inform the strategy of the cross-cutting aspect of NICIS "formerly known as SAGrid."

## Evolving the revolution

Production "service-grids" have had their day. The biggest one ever built (WLCG) showed  the inherent limitations and spectacular capability of the paradigm. Production service grids had a lot of competition, particularly from volunteer service grids (SETI, World Community Grid, etc). Instead of "dying", they have adopted the evolutionary benefits of clouds - resource virtualisation, flexible infrastructure management, self-service, pay-per-use, etc. The research methodologies being used are also crossing boundaries and domains. 15 years ago HPC and data infrastructure were considered necessary to very few research activities. Ten years ago, given the momentum created essentially by big physics projects' computing requirements these were adopted by other areas such as bioinformatics as the boundary of what was computationally feasible was beaten back by technological advance. The rise of the network, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, was a long-awaited revolution that followed democratic revolutions in many cases - one may argue that this is no coincidence.

Sticking with the the lustral theme, in 2010 'cloud computing' was so vaguely defined that it begged ridicule when considered as a serious replacement for production service grids. In 2015, proposing the deployment of a static, isolated (albeit federated and shared) infrastructure would negate the capacity of networks to reduce the barriers to collaboration which impede scientific discovery and innovation. Many claim that the rise of network capacity and fall in price of computing and data resources has led to a "democratisation" of science. What is meant is that there is a lower barrier to entry to research, since there are more resources available, to a wider range of researchers. However, this is not democracy, this is at best egalitariansim, and at worst demagogy. One of the unfortunate side effects of the rapid reduction in barriers to entry is that the sharing motive is undermined and there is a large temptation to "go it alone". This might lead eager groups, projects, initiatives to quickly develop even sizeable resources, instead of following a slower adoption route on shared or mutualised resources, only to discover later that there is a need to share. We refer to this as the "erosion of the commons".

# Your place or mine ?

The pillars of cyberinfrastructure have been identified in South Africa as Data, HPC and Network. These pillars make particular sense from a national funding agency perspective, influencing development of centralised interventions. However, in the real world, it's very hard to build something using only one pillar, be it a pillar of "techonlogy", or an institutional pillar. The point is that research is conducted with judicious, sometimes ubiquitous usage of all of these technology pillars, and frequently across institutional boundaries. Researchers do not identify as "HPC" users or "Data" users - and certainly not as belonging to a particular institute - they are simply researchers, so funding their activities within the ambit of any of these "pillars" creates unnecessary barriers. While the pillars are useful for funding agencies to channel their commitments into significant hardware investments, a false dichotomy has been created between services which are in reality complementary. The separation of pillars, while necessary and useful to central funding agencies, thus creates tension and inefficiencies both in the technical community entrusted to build and operate them, as well as the scientific communities which come to rely on them. There are very good reasons for having centralised funding (in order to address issues at schale) as well as independent or institutional funding streams (to ensure that there is a multiplicity and diversity in research and resources), however as often occurs, some convergence in activities is almost inevitable. When this occurs, whether it is technological, methodological, or scientific convergence, a means should exist whereby experience and resources can be shared.

## Avoiding 'Government Housing Project' - ensuring constituency-based participation

Not all South Africans have equal access to e-Science resources and services. It is unrealistic to insist that all research universities to instate their own stand-alone e-Science Centres; this can only be effectively done in a certain environment and at a certain scale. However, we cannot accept such inequalities in our scientific communities, and efforts should be made to ensure access to quality services and performant resources irrespective of geographic location. This could could be done by distributing resources, paid for by some central fund, to remote and disadvantaged communities

## The Craftsperson and the Third Career.

In a service-based economy, two distinct parties exist - the service *providers* and service *consumers*. There are distinct relationships between these two parties (service demand and supply for example), however it is assumed that there is very little overlap in activities. We have a model of modern IT professionals, working in a service-provision department, interacting via pre-agreed SLA's to provide services to professional researchers who select and consume them. However, given the cutting edge nature of these services, and the fact that they are operated within research environments, the reality is that there is often a great deal of overlap. Since there is such complexity in these platforms, at times there is no neat separation between research and research support staff. We have thus seen the emergence of a third career path, being neither researcher nor research support, and emergence of Research Software Engineers - craftspeople who work at the interface of a scientific domain, and the technologies which enable it. Innovation in this boundary between infrastructure, services, and science is highly creative, and difficult to fit into traditional institutional silos, or in our case cyberinfrastructure pillars. Whilst institutes in South Africa are starting to recognise this by the creation of e-Science Centres to employ the Research Software Engineers and Craftspeople, this trend has shown great payoff abroad.

In immediate terms, we consider that identifying and developing capacity in this new career path consists in identifying **relevant, transferable skills**. This is quite often conflated with the "DevOps" paradigm, where there is better empathy and collaboration between those operating infrastructures and those developing it; indeed, where they often are one and the same team.

## DevOps, Software-Defined Infrastructure and transferrable skills

One of the aspects to emerge from the cloud computing paradigm is that hardware and services are being presented to the user in ever-more abstract ways. Virtualisation and abstraction are expressed in any number of computer languages, and for a modern systems expert, a fluency in these languages is essential. At the same time, many of the tools and methodologies usually reserved for the analytic and scientific domains (software engineering, quality control, reproducible methods, visualisation, etc) are being adopted by infrastructure operators. This cross-over is part of what is meant by the new "DevOps" paradigm. The rise of this paradigm has led to what we might term "Software-defined infrastructure", where not only the *configuration* of services are described in computer languages, but also the *means to achieve their desired state*. This makes it possible to not only save and share entire e-Services, contingent only on access to the relevant hardware, but also to *execute* their configuration given a few relevant variables and initial conditions.
