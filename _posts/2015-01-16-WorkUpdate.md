TL;DR - I've been working on three projects this week. Jenkins has been tweaked, CVMFS is ready, and we're almost ready to release v0.0.4 of DevOps.

I missed the weekly SANREN project update meeting this week because my poor boy came down with the flu and I had to stick around at home to look after him. In the meantime, here's a short update of the work that's been done this week and some plans for next week.

## Central Operator on Duty (COD)

I took care of some tickets.

## CI Platform

Several new jobs have been registered in the SAGrid [Continuous Integration](https://ci.sagrid.ac.za) platform.

## DevOps

Pulled in contributions from @fmarco76 providing Ansible tasks for the Shibboleth authentication on the Science Gateway.
